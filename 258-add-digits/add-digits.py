# Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input: 38
# Output: 2 
# Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
# Â             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
#
#
# Follow up:
# Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
